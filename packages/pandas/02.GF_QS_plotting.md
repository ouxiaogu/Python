## GF Quad State

Model for GF case need to pass the Quad State minimum ratio: 85%. This is a model quality assessment method by the model error and spec.

The spec include 1D and 2D spec. For example 1D spec = 2nm, 2D spec = 4nm, then for a specific gauge, its spec value should be:

```
=IF(type="1D",IF(wafer_cd<100, 2, wafer_cd*0.02), IF(wafer_cd<100, 4, wafer_cd*0.04))
```

Then, based on the model error, spec and metrology sigma, they will classify the gauge into 4 groups:
    
    - A: measurement good, fit good
    - B: measurement bad, fit good
    - C: measurement bad, fit bad
    - D: measurement good, fit bad

Besides, in their QS state analysis method, model error will be analysis by groups. This plotting is meaningful for any other model fitting case. So I implement its method with python here.

## QS plotting by python

- For old pandas version please use QS-pandas-old.py
- For pandas version new than 0.17.0 please use QS-pandas-after-0.17.0.py

Below is an example of plotting:



About the ploting

1. Y axis at left contains two plot:

    Wafer_CD/ Model_CD through gauge 

2. Y axis at right contain 4 plot:

    - spec_min
    - spec_max
    - model_error
    - outlier(whose model_error is not in the range of [spec_min, spec_max]  ) , use red box marker

3. Group name are shown at the top left
4. some statistics of model error in this group are given: average, range, sigma and their togn_sgn
