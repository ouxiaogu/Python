## scalar list -> numpy array

- `np.atleast1d`


Convert inputs to arrays with at least one dimension.

Scalar inputs are converted to 1-dimensional arrays, whilst higher-dimensional inputs are preserved.


common usage

```py
a = list(arange(6))
y = np.atleast1d(a)
if y.ndim == 1:
    y = np.reshape(y, (-1, 1)) # covert into nX1 matrix format
```
