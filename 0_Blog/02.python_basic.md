## List

There are many tricks to manipulate list in python.

1. Create string list with fixed length 

    ```py
    strs = ["" for x in range(size)]
    ```

2. Return list without a specific element
    
    ```py
    suits = ["h","c", "d", "s"]
    noclubs = [x for x in suits if x != "c"] # method 1    
    noclubs = list(suits)
    noclubs.remove("c") # method 2
    ```

3. Reverse a list
    
    ```py
    L = [0,10,20,40]
    reversed(L) # method 1, turn to a listreverseiterator
    L[::-1] = # method 2, it's better
    ```
