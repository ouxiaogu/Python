    "List and [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#bytearray \"bytearray\") objects support additional operations that allow in-place modification of the object. Other mutable sequence types (when added to the language) should also support these operations. Strings and tuples are immutable sequence types: such objects cannot be modified once created. The following operations are defined on mutable sequence types (where *x* is an arbitrary object):\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *t* must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The C implementation of Python has historically accepted multiple parameters and implicitly joined them into a tuple; this no longer works in Python 2.0. Use of this misfeature has been deprecated since Python 1.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  *x* can be any iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Raises [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError \"exceptions.ValueError\") when *x* is not found in *s*. When a negative index is passed as the second or third parameter to the `index()` method, the list length is added, as for slice indices. If it is still negative, it is truncated to zero, as for slice indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed in version 2.3: Previously, `index()` didn’t have arguments for specifying start and stop positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  When a negative index is passed as the first parameter to the `insert()` method, the list length is added, as for slice indices. If it is still negative, it is truncated to zero, as for slice indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed in version 2.3: Previously, all negative indices were truncated to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  The `pop()` method’s optional argument *i* defaults to `-1`, so that by default the last item is removed and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  The `sort()` and `reverse()` methods modify the list in place for economy of space when sorting or reversing a large list. To remind you that they operate by side effect, they don’t return the sorted or reversed list.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  The `sort()` method takes optional arguments for controlling the comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *cmp* specifies a custom comparison function of two arguments (list items) which should return a negative, zero or positive number depending on whether the first argument is considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than the second argument: `cmp=lambda x,y:cmp(x.lower(), y.lower())`. The default value is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *key* specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element: `key=str.lower`. The default value is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *reverse* is a boolean value. If set to `True`, then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, the *key* and *reverse* conversion processes are much faster than specifying an equivalent *cmp* function. This is because *cmp* is called multiple times for each list element while *key* and *reverse* touch each element only once. Use [`functools.cmp_to_key()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key \"functools.cmp_to_key\") to convert an old-style *cmp* function to a *key* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed in version 2.3: Support for `None` as an equivalent to omitting *cmp* was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed in version 2.4: Support for *key* and *reverse* was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Starting with Python 2.3, the `sort()` method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal — this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **CPython implementation detail:** While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python 2.3 and newer makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exceptions.ValueError \"exceptions.ValueError\") if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort.\n",
