List of Lecture Topics

##  Lecture 1 - Introduction:
    
1. What a computer does
    - calculation
        + primitive
        + your method to calculate
    - record result
2. Computational thinking
    computation 
    
    - declarative knowledge: 陈述性知识
    - imperative knowledge: 探索性知识, Imperative knowledge is a description of how to deduce something
        + `recipe`: guess -> (test/ halt condition)stop if _g*g = x _-> otherwise, new guess, _1/2\*(g + x/g)_ -> repeat with new guess
        + the above `recipe` is not a `program` yet, because computer computers cannot guess a starting value for y, we need to bring out another `recipe` for how to guess
        + algorithm are recipes
        
3. Basic machine architecture
    - Fixed program computer, e.g. calculater
    - stored program computer
        + sequence of instructions
            * predefined set of primitive
                - arithmetic and logic
                - simple test
                - moving data
        + interpreter: execute/ run the instruction in order
    
    basic machine architecture

        - Memory
        - ALU: arithmetic logic unit accumulator
        - Control Unit: program counter
        - INPUT
        - OUTPUT

    Six primitives

        - "tuning complete" common in language 
        - modern lang.
        - abstract method to create new "primitives"

4. Aspects of programming languages

    - a set of primitive operations
    - prog lang: numbers, strings, simple operators
    - syntax(语法, 规范): Determines whether a string is legal. well-formed string, char and symbols
    - static semantics(静态语义学) 主谓宾组合解释， Determines whether a string has meaning
        + prog: py *<literal> <operator> <literal>* is valid
        + prog: always have exact meaning
        + Eng: "I can't praise the student more higher" praise or sarcasm
    - semantics: Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence 

    root cause of bugs wrong

    - syntactic error : common but easily caught
    - statics semantic error: (e.g. loop a empty dict)
        + some lang check before run
        + if not caught, unpredictable behavior
    - logical error: not statics semantic error, but meaning may not be what was intending
    
    i.o.l.
    individual objective list
    - learn syntax, semantic
    - learn how to translate the "recipe" for solving problem into a form accept by computer can run through
    - develop computational modes of thought, help to quickly, correctly use most suitable methods   

## Lecture 2 - Core elements of programs:

1. Kinds of languages
    

    python 

    sequence of *definition* and *commands* 

2. Objects, expressions, operators
    
    objects: type
    
    - scalar object:
        + int
        + float
        + boolean


3. Abstraction by naming
4. Strings
5. Scripts
6. Straight line programs
7. Branching programs

## Lecture 3 - Simple algorithms:

1. Simple programs
2. Iteration
3. Input
4. Exhaustive enumeration
5. Guess and check
6. For and while loops
7. Approximate solutions
