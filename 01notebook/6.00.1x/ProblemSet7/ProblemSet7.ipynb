You can view the XML source with your browser's \"View Page Source\" function, though it probably will not make much sense to you. Abstractly, whenever you connect to the Google News RSS feed, you receive a list of items. Each entry in this list represents a single news item. In a Google News feed, every entry has the following fields:\n",

    "guid : A globally unique identifier for this news story.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why do we want this? When all is said and done, we want an application that aggregates several RSS feeds from various sources and can act on all of them in the exact same way: we should be able to read news stories from various RSS feeds all in one place. If you've ever used an RSS feed reader, be assured that it has had to solve the exact problem we're going to tackle in this pset!\n",

Your task, in this problem, is to write a class, NewsStory, starting with a constructor that takes (guid, title, subject, summary, link) as arguments and stores them appropriately. NewsStory also needs to contain the following methods:\n",

    "test = NewsStory('foo', 'myTitle', 'mySubject', 'some long summary', 'www.example.com')\n",
    "then test.getGuid() will return foo.\n",

    "PART 2: TRIGGERS (WORDTRIGGERS)  (20 points possible)\n",
    "Given a set of news stories, your program will generate alerts for a subset of those stories. Stories with alerts will be displayed to the user, and the other stories will be silently discarded. We will represent alerting rules as triggers. A trigger is a rule that is evaluated over a single news story and may fire to generate an alert. For example, a simple trigger could fire for every news story whose title contained the word \"Microsoft\". Another trigger may be set up to fire for all news stories where the summary contained the word \"Boston\". Finally, a more specific trigger could be set up to fire only when a news story contained both the words \"Microsoft\" and \"Boston\" in the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simplify our code, we will use object polymorphism. We will define a trigger interface and then implement a number of different classes that implement that trigger interface in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRIGGER INTERFACE\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trigger class you define should implement the following interface, either directly or transitively. It must implement the evaluate method that takes a news item (NewsStory object) as an input and returns True if an alert should be generated for that item. We will not directly use the implementation of the Trigger class, which is why it throws an exception should anyone attempt to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "The class below implements the Trigger interface (you will not modify this). Any subclass that inherits from it will have an evaluate method. By default, they will use the evaluate method in Trigger, the superclass, unless they define their own evaluate function, which would then be used instead. If some subclass neglects to define its own evaluate() method, calls to it will go to Trigger.evaluate(), which fails (albeit cleanly) with the NotImplementedError exception:\n",

    "        raise NotImplementedError\n",
    "We will define a number of classes that inherit from Trigger. In the figure below, Trigger is a superclass, which all other classes inherit from.

    "\n",
    "Having a trigger that always fires isn't interesting; let's write some that are. A user may want to be alerted about news items that contain specific words. For instance, a simple trigger could fire for every news item whose title contains the word \"Microsoft\". In the following problems, you will create a WordTrigger abstract class and implement three classes that inherit from this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigger should fire when the whole word is present. For example, a trigger for \"soft\" should fire on:\n",

    "I prefer pillows that are soft.\n",

    "\n",

    "Because this is an abstract class, we will not be directly instantiating any WordTriggers. WordTrigger should inherit its evaluate method from Trigger. We do this because now we can create subclasses of WordTrigger that use its isWordIn method. In this way, it is much like the Trigger interface, except now actual code from this WordTrigger class is used in its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROBLEM 3\n",

    "You are now ready to implement WordTrigger's three subclasses: TitleTrigger, SubjectTrigger, and SummaryTrigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a word trigger class, TitleTrigger, that fires when a news item's title contains a given word. The word should be an argument to the class's constructor. This trigger should not be case-sensitive (it should treat \"Intel\" and \"intel\" as being equal).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an instance of this type of trigger could be used to generate an alert whenever the word \"Intel\" occurred in the title of a news item. Another instance could generate an alert whenever the word \"Microsoft\" occurred in the title of an item.\n",

    "PROBLEM 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a word trigger class, SubjectTrigger, that fires when a news item's subject contains a given word. The word should be an argument to the class's constructor. This trigger should not be case-sensitive.\n",
