PROBLEM 1-1  (1 point possible)

    Suppose x = "me" and y = "myself". The lines of code x = y and then y = x will swap the values of x and y, resulting in x = "myself" and y = "me".


PROBLEM 1-2  (1 point possible)

    Suppose x is an integer in the following code:

    def f(x):
        while x > 3:
            f(x+1)

    For any value of x, all calls to f are guaranteed to never terminate.
 

PROBLEM 1-3  (1 point possible)

    A Python program may execute a line of code more than once.

 
PROBLEM 1-4  (1 point possible)

    In Python, a list can be aliased.

 
PROBLEM 1-5  (1 point possible)

    The following code will enter an infinite loop for all values of i and j.

    while i >= 0:
        while j >= 0:
            print i, j
 
PROBLEM 1-6  (1 point possible)

    A Python dictionary is a mutable object.

PROBLEM 1-7  (1 point possible)
    
    It is always possible and feasible for a programmer to come up with test cases that run through every possible path in a program.

PROBLEM 1-8  (1 point possible)

    A program that contains the line x = 3'a' is syntactically incorrect.

PROBLEM 1-9  (1 point possible)

    Consider the following function.

    def f(x):
        a = []
        while x > 0:
            a.append(x)
            f(x-1)

    A new object of type list is created for each recursive invocation of f.
 
PROBLEM 1-10  (1 point possible)

    Any number that can be represented as a decimal fraction can be represented exactly in floating point representation in Python.
