    "RADIATION EXPOSURE\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Radioactive decay\" is the process by which an unstable atom loses energy and emits ionizing particles - what is commonly refered to as radiation. Exposure to radiation can be dangerous and is very important to measure to ensure that one is not exposed to too terribly much of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The radioactivity of a material decreases over time, as the material decays. A radioactive decay curve describes this decay. The x-axis measures time, and the y-axis measures the amount of activity produced by the radioactive sample. 'Activity' is defined as the rate at which the nuclei within the sample undergo transititions - put simply, this measures how much radiation is emitted at any one point in time. The measurement of activity is called the Becquerel (Bq). \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the requirements for your game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in`words.txt`. The functions for loading the word list and selecting a random word have already been provided for you in `ps3_hangman.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The game must be interactive; the flow of the game should go as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   After each round, you should also display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Some additional rules of the game:\n",
    "    *   A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round. Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   A user loses a guess **only** when s/he guesses incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he \"loses\"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.\n",
