    "> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",

    "Consider a similar problem to the Monty Hall problem:\n",

    "In this problem, instead of 3 doors, 1 car, and 2 goats, instead there are 4 doors, 2 cars and 2 goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the Monty Hall problem, the player chooses a door, and then the host opens a door hiding a goat. With simulation or hand calculation, calculate the probability that switching into a door will lead you to a car. Enter your answer as a fraction or decimal in the following box:\n"
